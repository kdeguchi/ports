A simple bridge between colord and X. It does the following tasks:

  * Enumerates displays and register them in colord.
  * Creates default ICC profiles based on EDID data.
  * Applies ICC profiles provided by colord.
  * Maintains user's private ICC storage directory.

The primary goal of xiccd is providing color profile support for
desktop environments other than Gnome and KDE (Xfce, LXDE, and
probably others) that don't support native color management yet.
