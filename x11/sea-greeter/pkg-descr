Another LightDM greeter made with WebKitGTK2.

Sea (like C) greeter for LightDM allows to create themes
with web technologies, the same as web-greeter, nody-greeter
and the outdated lightdm-webkit2-greeter. This project aims
to be similar to the last one, as sea-greeter is made with
webkit2 instead of chromium.
